Task#1
the user enters the value of a number using input method.
than we define a function named as factorial of that number.
we will than use if else statement as it is conditional based operation.
The condition is that if the value of n is less than 2 then its output will return as 1 else it will be returned as n*(n-1)
As we know that the factorial of a number could be found by the formula:
n! = n*(n-1)
so if the value of n is 5 than the value will be 5*4*3*2*1 which is 120.
The output will be displayed using print method.


Task#2

Here the user enters the value of a number as n.
The math module is imported to use mathematical functions.
we will be using import method to find the mathematical functions.
The math.sqrt(n) calculates the square root of n and prints it.
The math.log(n) calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of n and prints it.
The math.sin(n) calculates the sine of n (where n is in radians) and prints it.
the result of these methematical functions are calculated by using a dot after the math module followed by the functions.
the output is displayed using print method.
